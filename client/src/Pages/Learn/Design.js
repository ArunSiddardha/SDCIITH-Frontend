    This is most neglected part in IITH when we they build the products for the campus. They usually neglect this. But if we are to use a product then this design plays the most important role. So i want to take a team this time in such a way that we have most passionate designers in the SDC. And UI/UX plays an immportant in engaging the crowd and building a brand. And the Basics of getting started with UI is pretty well documented and given u can follow and learn about the UI/UX.

      <ul className='text-md md:text-lg text-[#3B454E]'>
      Hello and welcome to the SDC. We are a team of developers who work around the clock to build things.
      </ul>
     
  
      <div className='text-2xl lg:text-3xl text-[#3B454E] font-bold my-5'>Things we do
</div>
<ul className='text-md md:text-lg text-[#3B454E]'>
  <li className='m-2 '>
    <strong>Skill enhancement:</strong> We will be organising certified workshops and much more to help you learn a new skill or improve an existing one by providing you with the correct mentoring and well documented resources.And we will be also mentoring your own persnol dev project which might be an extension, bot any other thing.
  </li>
  <li className='m-2'>
  <strong>Meetups:</strong> We'll conduct meetups with a great community of developers and aspiring developers in campus to discuss ideas for the products to work on with and learn about best practises in the development world. 
  </li>
  <li className='m-2'>
  <strong>Developement:</strong> We will create best products(Apps and websites) that will be used by the whole IITH student body, as well as campus administrators and alumni.
  </li>
  <li className='m-2'>
  <strong>Networking:</strong> Participate in meetups and workshops conducted in association with different communities to get to know interesting people while picking up new skills along the way.
  </li>
  </ul>
      <div className='text-2xl lg:text-3xl text-[#3B454E] font-bold my-5'>Who are we? Why did we make this community?
</div>
      <ul className='text-md md:text-lg text-[#3B454E] text-[#3B454E]'>
        <li >
        We're just a group of IITH students who like building stuff. We realised that our ability to build things had helped us and people around us in numerous ways. However, we saw a lack of development and mentorship culture at IITH. Also, there aren't enough appropriate products(Apps and Websites) for usage on campus. We wanted to demonstrate how much fun it is to create things so that others may create things that help more people. And We also wanted to demonstrate how appropriate products might aid students and school officials in their job processes. <strong>In summary, we established this community in order to serve others and encourage others to help others, resulting in a culture.</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div className='text-2xl lg:text-3xl text-[#3B454E] font-bold my-5'>What will you learn?</div>
      <ul className='text-md md:text-lg text-[#3B454E] text-[#3B454E]'>
        <li >
        Aside from mastering the skills. With an actual real-life project, you will learn how a team works and how to lead and manage one. And you'll meet a lot of folks who will mentor you. And from your other mentors, you will learn about the critical elements that are vital to you, as well as how it will be when working on a real project. In this way, we will develop a community culture in our dev community.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div className='text-2xl lg:text-3xl text-[#3B454E] font-bold my-5'>How are we different from Lambda (Dev club of IITH)?</div>
      <ul className='text-md md:text-lg text-[#3B454E] text-[#3B454E]'>
      Lambda is an IITH development club that focuses on educating students how to grow and instilling a development culture in them. And their main responsibilities include running sessions, hackathons, hosting events for Milan and Elan, and leading seminars. And how are we different here? Our major objective is to create goods that will be used by the IITH campus community and administration, and that are in high demand (You can see our projects beside). And our key goal is to have a more flexible staff with the greatest designers, with the utmost attention paid to the UI and UX so that the app is usable.We will construct them as quickly as possible and to a fixed timetable, as this is our primary task. Our main job is to make Products(which is the official differentiation).

      <div className='text-2xl lg:text-3xl text-[#3B454E] font-bold my-5'>Why do we do the things we do?</div>
      <ul className='text-md md:text-lg text-[#3B454E] text-[#3B454E]'>
        <li >
        Today, our IIT is beset by difficulties. Lack of culture, mentorship, Lack of platforms for fundamental things (leading to email spam), alumni relationships, and dying clubs . People are becoming increasingly interested in doing things, but they are unsure about how to go. So we came to the conclusion that the best way to tackle the challenges was to bring together the appropriate individuals with the right abilities on the right platform to serve others and to develop a culture.<strong>We actually dont believe in getting PORs for showcasing so thats not what we go for.</strong>We attempt to make it simple for users to find important information or to find those who have it. As a result, we decided that this would be our vision and mission.
        </li>

      <div className='text-2xl lg:text-3xl text-[#3B454E] font-bold my-5'>Vision and Mission</div>
      <ul className='text-md md:text-lg text-[#3B454E]'>
        <li  >
        Our goal in founding this community is to provide students with hands-on experience designing, building, and managing websites, apps, and products, as well as to instil a development culture on campus. With the right mentorship and resources, you can design, create, and launch creative apps, websites, and products for institutes, clubs, informal associations, and festivals.
          </li>
          <br></br>
          <li>
          Our goal is to improve the IITH environment. We, as a team, strive relentlessly to create IITH a better environment for students, as its abbreviation (Inventing and innovating Technology for humanity) suggests. We want to create items that will be beneficial to IITH students. We aim to share information that will assist IITH students. As a result, as a community, we are working to improve IITH.
